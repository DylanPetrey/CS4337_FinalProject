# CS4337_FinalProject
Organization of Programming languages final project

This was my final project for my Organization of Programming Languages class. My assignment was to create a programming language given the semantics.
What this program does is that it takes the input file into the lexer. Which then converts it into tokens to be interpreted by the parser.

lexer.py -> lexer
parser.py -> parser
lexurInput.txt -> input for the parser program

To run this program, make sure to have the parser.py, lexur.py, and the lexerInput.txt in
the same python project.
